It is a simple app to create some working hours for a day

I didn't use serializer  or anything complicated even if i can, 
to make it so clear to logic
and simple to understand 

commands to run:
- pip3 install -r requirements.txt
- ./manage.py makemigrations 
- ./manage.py migrate 
- ./manage.py test
- ./manage.py runserver
